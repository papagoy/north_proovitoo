        You have completed first step and started the test assignment application. This is not finely polished high availability application developed with
        all the best practices in mind but it will fit the needs of this assignment just fine. After all one of the goals is to test your ability to dig
        through a bit messy code that we all sometimes encounter in some legacy applications. As a reward for reaching this step, take some time to watch an
        episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBUmVQEtA_4" title="Regular show" target="_blank">Regular Show</a>. That show was an inspiration for this assignments
        story.
